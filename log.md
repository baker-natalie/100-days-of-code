# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 9 January, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I built an ad for the community collaboration I am working on

**Thoughts** I have not stayed sharp on my CSS positioning and it shows.

### Day 2: 10 January, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started a mobile-responsive GIF vision board. I also further adjusted the CSS on the ad from yesterday.

**Thoughts** This was just some fun.

### Day 3: 11 January, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a ReactJS project.

**Thoughts** This one's not ready for the light of day yet, as it's part of a collaborative project that isn't ready to be unveiled yet.

### Day 4: 12 January, Thursday

**Today's Progress** Tried to make a memoizing function go. Failed so far.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make the gifs on my vision board display randomly, without repeating, so I tried to call a memoizing function that would randomize and store the images called until they were all displayed. I think I've got the pieces, just trying to stitch them together.
