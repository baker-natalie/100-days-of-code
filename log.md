**Today's Progress**: Worked on a ReactJS project.

### Day 4: 12 January, Thursday

**Today's Progress** Tried to make a memoizing function go. Failed so far.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make the gifs on my vision board display randomly, without repeating, so I tried to call a memoizing function that would randomize and store the images called until they were all displayed. I think I've got the pieces, just trying to stitch them together.
